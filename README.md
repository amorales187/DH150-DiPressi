More classes, could be a better symbol, such as a plus for more or the three dots. Three dots takes you to settings and that goes to one setting of time, this could be better, since there is only one option in settings here to have a different icon of a bell (for notificationsâ€”what this haptic is used for) or have less clicking around to do to only have one option.
