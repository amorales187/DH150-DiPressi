Heuristic and description | CCLE heuristic evaluation
--------------------------|---------------------------
**Visibility of system status:** The web/app gives the user feedback in a timely manner concerning the actions they are currently doing. | Has loading clock visible. Bottom icon is highlighted to show you where you are
**Match between system and real world:** Design and icons are based off of general knowledge. Things the user will easily recognize. | Bad: graph, not necessarily reflective of grades, not as easily recognizable; with in calendar there is a funnel: which means??? More classes, could be a better symbol, such as a plus for more or the three dots. Three dots takes you to settings and that goes to one setting of time, this could be better, since there is only one option in settings here to have a different icon of a bell (for notifications—what this haptic is used for) or have less clicking around to do to only have one option. 
**User control and freedom:** User has options, such as undo or redo. | In notifications, there is a list of notifications that have been sent by instructor to the class through CCLE. I have multiple messages but there is no back button. Three dots at the top do not have a back button 
**Consistency and standards:** Design and usage is consistent across all pages of the web/app. | Some drop down menus are not the same style: check in circle; smaller, dark circle in larger one. Square vs circle in one case. Click on a class and give at the top: Contents, Grades, Competencies?????
**Error prevention:** Provide safety nets for user, such as confirming an action. | There is a save button for when submitting assignments 
**Recognition rather than recall:** Provide suggestions or context in actions. | Search courses, doesn’t search your courses but searches for other courses
