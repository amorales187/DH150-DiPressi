evaluation of the app

Heuristic and description | CCLE heuristic evaluation | Improvement 
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------
**Visibility of system status:** The web/app gives the user feedback in a timely manner concerning the actions they are currently doing. | *Good:* Has loading clock visible. Bottom icon is highlighted to show you where you are. | NA
**Match between system and real world:** Design and icons are based off of general knowledge. Things the user will easily recognize. | **Bad:** The graph at the bottom is not necessarily reflective of grades, not as easily recognizable. Within calendar there is a funnel, which has an unclear meaning More classes, could be a better symbol, such as a plus for more or the three dots. Three dots takes you to settings and that goes to one setting of time, this could be better, since there is only one option in settings here to have a different icon of a bell (for notifications—what this haptic is used for) or have less clicking around to do to only have one option. The graph at the bottom is not necessarily reflective of grades, not as easily recognizable. Within calendar there is a funnel, which has an unclear meaning - it means other classes. Three dots in calendar takes you to settings and that goes to a setting of notification time. | Improvement: The graph could be changed to an A+ symbol. The funnel could be a plus (indicating for more) or three dots. The notification time setting can be better, since there is only one option in settings, to have a different icon of a bell is better for notifications.
**User control and freedom:** User has options, such as undo or redo. | In notifications, there is a list of notifications that have been sent by instructor to the class through CCLE. I have multiple messages but there is no back button. Three dots at the top do not have a back button 
**Consistency and standards:** Design and usage is consistent across all pages of the web/app. | Some drop down menus are not the same style: check in circle; smaller, dark circle in larger one. Square vs circle in one case. Click on a class and give at the top: Contents, Grades, Competencies?????
**Error prevention:** Provide safety nets for user, such as confirming an action. | There is a save button for when submitting assignments 
**Recognition rather than recall:** Provide suggestions or context in actions. | Search courses, doesn’t search your courses but searches for other courses
**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Make a page that is accessible to all, have basic functions at the forefront and more advanced options accessible through more steps. |General settings and then more advanced, less used ones separate, such as synching.
**Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Design is not cluttered and easily accessible. | The large colored bars for each class at the home page are not needed. They clutter the page and make it so you have to scroll more. 
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Have a non-concerning message about an error and give information on how to fix it of move forward. | Error notifications have to be manually put on. Through a 4 step process.
**Help and documentation:** Have easily accessible and understandable help pages or pages with commonly asked questions. | Help takes you to an outside page, out of the app.The help seems to be more catered to administrators, rather than users. No search for help. No faq, common issues. No Trouble shooting. Help does not reflect the app or how it looks
